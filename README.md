# Python Linalg Module

Code for a project investigating various linear algebra algorithms including:

* Matrix multiplication:
    + Naive
    + Recursive
    + Strassen
    + discussion [on my blog](http://charlesfranzen.com/posts/time-complexity-of-matrix-multiplication/)

* Matrix reductions:
    + Givens Rotations
    + Householder Reflections
    + Upper Hessenberg Reduction

* The QR algorithm:
    + Naive
    + Upper Hessenberg
